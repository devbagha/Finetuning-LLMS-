# Finetuning-LLMS

## NOTES: 

Full Precision / HAlf Precision : Data - > related to data types how it is stored in memory -> data types : weights and parameters
Callibration -> in mmodel quantization
Modes of Quantization :  Post training - Quantization Aware Training
Quantization: conversion from higher memory format to lower memory format
Weights are in the form of matrix - > Every value is stored in memory in the form of 32bits
